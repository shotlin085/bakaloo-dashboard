"use client"

/**
 * Coupons hooks — wraps the existing coupon endpoints so each cache entry
 * is keyed by `qk.coupons(shopKey, params)` and therefore participates in
 * the Shop_Switcher's predicate-based invalidation (Req 3.4, 10.3).
 *
 * Coupons are designed as a per-shop surface (Req 10.5 lists "shop-scoped
 * coupons" among the SINGLE_SHOP-only sections); the page itself renders
 * `<EmptyShopState />` outside `SINGLE_SHOP` mode, but the hook still
 * keys its query by `shopKey` so the cache lines never bleed across shops.
 *
 * The list query is gated by `enabled: shopKey !== "NONE"` to mirror the
 * convention from `useOrders` / `useShopProductsList`. `mode` defaults to
 * `"UNSELECTED"` (see shop-context.store.ts) until an admin explicitly
 * enters a shop or HQ mode, so that gate is `false` by default.
 *
 * That default-off gate is right for the Coupons page itself, but several
 * other admin surfaces (Spin & Win / Scratch Card prizes, cart milestones,
 * first-time offers, abandoned-cart coupon sends) reuse this same hook just
 * to populate a "pick an existing coupon" dropdown for a feature that has
 * no shop concept at all — GET /coupons isn't even shop-filtered server-side
 * (see coupons.controller.js#listAll). Left at the default, those pickers
 * silently render empty until the admin happens to have a shop selected,
 * which looks exactly like "the coupon isn't there" even though it is.
 * Pass `{ shopScoped: false }` from any such caller to fetch unconditionally.
 *

 * The per-coupon analytics query is keyed on `id` only — it is not
 * shop-scoped on the backend, and the coupon id itself uniquely identifies
 * the analytics row.
 *
 * Requirements: 10.1, 10.3, 10.5
